# SI-Card8 programming investigation

The desktop inspector and name preview work with SI-Card8. Card writes are
not implemented. Name preparation remains in shared Kotlin code for future
Android reuse.

## Verified name limit

On 2026-09-18, a temporary Mac console probe called the documented field-support,
field-length, and personal-data validation APIs in the supplied SPORTident
Communication library, version 2.59.0 (internal test release dated 2024-05-10).
The probe used the default character set and ASCII names. It did not connect
to a station or call a write method.

The validator reports a combined first-name plus last-name maximum of **23
characters** for SI-Card8. Its character count excludes separators. Individual
first-name and last-name limits are also 23, and club is unsupported.

| First-name length | Last-name length | Vendor result | Reported count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | Valid | 0 |
| 11 | 11 | Valid | 22 |
| 12 | 11 | Valid | 23 |
| 23 | 0 | Valid | 23 |
| 0 | 23 | Valid | 23 |
| 12 | 12 | Too long | 24 |
| 24 | 0 | Too long | 24 |
| 0 | 24 | Too long | 24 |

This replaces the initial conservative preview rule of 24 bytes including two
separators, which unnecessarily rejected names totaling 23 characters. The
preview still accepts only printable ASCII excluding semicolons and removes
outer spaces explicitly. Accented-name write encoding has not been verified.

The shared planner's encoded text is for round-tripping through the existing
read parser. It is **not a write payload**. Neither the read parser's larger
owner-data region nor the validator's character count establishes a writable
memory range, separator/terminator format, padding, or serial command.

## Write support and remaining questions

### Config+ hardware read verification

On 2026-09-18, SPORTident Config+ 2.12.0 in a Windows ARM64 VM read a
BSM8 UART1 USB station running firmware 657 and an SI-Card8 through its
Config SI-Cards view. Windows used the official SPORTident USB driver released
2026-06-09, which supports ARM64. Config+ showed blank first/last names and
11 existing punch records. Only first and last names were supported; the
other personal-data fields were marked unsupported.

After explicit approval of a test write and possible punch loss, Config+
programmed the fictional first/last names `Mickey` / `Mouse` using its default
MCP7830-compatible character set. Auto apply and feedback editing remained
disabled. The resulting read entry showed the same card number, both desired
names, and 11 punch records. The displayed clear, check, start, and finish
values matched the earlier read. A separate read after physical removal and
reinsertion, with personal-data editing and Auto apply disabled, confirmed the
same card number, `Mickey` / `Mouse`, 11 records, and unchanged displayed clear,
check, start, and finish values. Duplicate entries were enabled in Config+ to
make this identical repeat read visible. Individual control-punch records have
not been compared.

This establishes a working vendor-application write path with the available
station and card, without clearing the reported punch count in this trial.
It does not establish Mac write support, raw write framing, or punch
preservation for every programming operation. Owner editing was disabled
after the test and remained disabled during the separate read-only verification.

### Integration questions

The supplied library's native serial transport was verified on macOS ARM64
using .NET runtime 10.0.7 and Microsoft's System.IO.Ports 10.0.7 dependency.
A licensed, bounded read-only probe opened `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` at 38400
baud, read the expected BSM8 UART1 USB station number and product through
`GetSystemData` / `StationConfigRead`, and closed the connection. Radio-Oracle
was closed and the station was disconnected from the Windows VM for exclusive
serial access. No card-programming API was called by the Mac probe.

The documented custom communication handler also opened and closed on macOS
in an offline probe. It required the same System.IO.Ports dependency even
without a native serial handler. The working native transport makes a custom
serial implementation unnecessary for the first desktop integration.

The optional [SDK station probe](../tools/sportident-sdk-probe/README.md) makes
the hardware check repeatable using private SDK/license file paths. Its
repository version was built without warnings and verified against the real
station. A wrong expected station returned failure and closed the serial
connection. Missing-license and invalid-argument cases also returned failure;
none of these trials exposed license values. The desktop app does not yet
invoke or package this tool.

The supplied library's API documentation exposes personal-data programming,
validation, progress, and completion facilities. The Mac station read and
Config+ card write establish an SDK route to investigate next; they do not
establish a working Mac card-write integration. The
documentation inspected does not explain punch preservation or the raw write
transaction. The supplied deprecated PC Programmer's Guide describes card
readout, but does not specify a personal-data write command.

Request current programming documentation or a supported SI-Card8 write example
from [SPORTident developer support](https://www.sportident.com/support/developers)
covering:

- SI-Card8 personal-data command framing, addressing, acknowledgements, and
  compatible download stations and firmware.
- Exact first/last-name representation, separators, terminators, padding,
  encoding, and reserved bytes.
- Whether programming clears punches, and how to preserve card identity and
  unrelated settings.
- Card removal, timeout, interruption, and retry behavior; a write must never
  silently move to a different card.

If an SDK bridge is used instead of a documented serial command, verify card
read/write behavior on the Mac and obtain a supported release version. Account for packaging
the .NET runtime/library and injecting a licensed key without adding secrets
to public source. A desktop bridge would be separate from the shared Kotlin
planner and would require a separate Android integration later.

Once transport is verified, implement an explicit write action targeting the
freshly read card, followed by read-back verification of its number and names.
This workflow primarily targets new cards. If writing clears existing punches,
disclose that before writing. SDK completion alone is insufficient evidence
that the desired names were stored.

Vendor archives, extracted API documentation, binaries, and credentials stay
outside this repository. No binary inspection, decompilation, or serial command
guessing was used in this investigation.
